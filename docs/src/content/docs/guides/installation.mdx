## Prerequisites

### Engine specific
To ensure safe and efficient execution of translated code for evaluation, the InterTrans Engine relies on Singularity containers. Additionally, Go is required for installing the InterTrans Engine. 

Before proceeding, please make sure the necessary prerequisites are installed. Use the following guides to complete the installation:

- [ðŸ”— Guide to Installing Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [ðŸ”— Guide to Installing Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps)

### Inference backend
You can use the OpenAI API or any other inference tool that is compatible with OpenAI API specification. We officially support [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), and we recommend it to be used as the inference backend. Other alternatives that we have not tested but should be compatible include HuggingFace Text Generation Interface and LiteLLM.

## Installation
<Aside>We are working on packaging InterTrans as a standalone executable. In the meantime, please run it directly from the repository as indicated below.</Aside>

    <Steps>
    1. Clone a version from the repository. Use "Latest" for the latest version and "Replication" for paper replication purposes.
        <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Latest">
        ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/RISElabQueens/intertrans
            cd InterTrans
            git checkout main
            ```
          </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="Replication">
            <Aside>This version should only be used when replicating the paper's results as it may not contain newer features and enhancements. You can download the data from the paper's experiments [clicking here](https://queensuca-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/22dtfk_queensu_ca/EaBAUeorTCJJn_0_veaPJU0BodIj-XMX5FsGQYIAJYj0gA?e=63NSDK) to run the Notebooks without re-running the experiments.</Aside>
            ```bash
                git clone https://github.com/RISElabQueens/intertrans
                cd InterTrans
                git checkout paper
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

    2. Install the Python client

        ```bash
        cd client
        pip install -e .
        ```
    </Steps>
