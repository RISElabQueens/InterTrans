Benchmarking LLMs for code translation is essential to understand the capabilities and limitations of the LLM in your dataset. For this purpose, there exist several benchmark datasets that are widely used in the research community. This page provides a list of such benchmarks with download links. They can be easily used with CodeTransEngine to evaluate your LLM or translation methodology.

<Aside type='tip'>Have you created a dataset? Please consider contributing by adding it to this page so everyone can benefit from it! [Learn how to contribute](/CodeTransEngine/guides/contribute)</Aside>
