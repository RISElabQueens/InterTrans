# CodeTransEngine

## Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for CodeTransEngine. This is a **ready-to-use backend** for Large Language Model (LLM) based code translation across programming languages. This tool enables practitioners to translate source code across programming languages at scale, by leveraging off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLM). This backend integrates the Tree of Code Translation (ToCT) algorithm used in the CodeTransEngine Paper can be used with few-shot prompting, agents or newer algorithms.

## 🌟 Why use CodeTransEngine?

CodeTransEngine serves as a **backend** for code translation, helping you save time and effort in building such infrastructure from scratch. It is **extensible** and **high-performant** due to its concurrent architecture and other optimizations. 

### Features
- 🧠 Multiple algorithms (CodeTransEngine, Direct Translation, Few-shot Prompting and more)
- ⚡ Efficient inference using vLLM as backend and OpenAI Compatible APIs
- 🌐 Distributed inference supported
- 🛡️ Safe and containerized code execution
- 📊 Automatic translation evaluation using test-cases
- 🔧 Extensible to new datasets, prompts and translation algorithms 
- ♻️ Configurable cache for resource saving
- 🚆 Fully concurrent architecture for maximum throughput or sequential for resource saving 
- 🔗 Can be used standalone or integrated into existing workflows for code translation
