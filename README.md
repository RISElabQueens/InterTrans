# üõ§Ô∏è InterTrans

**üö® News (2025-01-21):** We're excited to share that our paper [*InterTrans: Leveraging Transitive Intermediate Translations to Enhance LLM-based Code Translation*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01063) has been accepted to the Main Research Track of the [47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2025)!

## Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for InterTrans Engine. This is a **ready-to-use backend** for Large Language Model (LLM) based code translation across programming languages. This tool enables practitioners to translate source code across programming languages at scale, by leveraging off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLM). This backend integrates the Tree of Code Translation (ToCT) algorithm used in the InterTrans Paper can be used with few-shot prompting, agents or newer algorithms.

## üåü Why use InterTrans Engine?

InterTrans Engine serves as a **backend** for code translation, helping you save time and effort in building such infrastructure from scratch. It is **extensible** and **high-performant** due to its concurrent architecture and other optimizations. 

### Features
- üß† Multiple algorithms (InterTrans, Direct Translation, Few-shot Prompting and more)
- ‚ö° Efficient inference using vLLM as backend and OpenAI Compatible APIs
- üåê Distributed inference supported
- üõ°Ô∏è Safe and containerized code execution
- üìä Automatic translation evaluation using test-cases
- üîß Extensible to new datasets, prompts and translation algorithms 
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Configurable cache for resource saving
- üöÜ Fully concurrent architecture for maximum throughput or sequential for resource saving 
- üîó Can be used standalone or integrated into existing workflows for code translation
